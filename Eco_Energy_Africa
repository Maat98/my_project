My Project Name: Eco Energy Africa

Project Description:
Eco Energy Africa is Bio gas fuel project ideated and inovated to solve the problem of cooking fuel in Africa Institutions and Homes.
Being eco frienly and green energy, Bio gas had been considered to be the best fuel enegy since it is environmental friendly and cheaper than firewood.
A large portion of fuel demand comes from Kenya's schools and about 90% of schools use firewood for cooking and pay up to USD 20,000 per year for the wood, 
which makes cooking fuel one of the biggest expenses in schools' meal budgets, but when using Bio gas only USD 2000 will be required for the installation of
the Bio gas plant for a school and USD 750 for yearly maintainace fee.
Appart from cost and environmental advantage of Biogas, there are move advantages such as; It give us nutrient rich slurry that can be used for crop production,
Availability of biogas would reduce the use of firewood and hence trees could be saved hence bringing beutiful environment and
economically there will be source of employment to people therefore making living standard better.
Therefore, I am highly recommending the use of Bio Gas as the best fuel.
